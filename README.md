## Viewing your data
[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is a useful tool for viewing archived packet data.
It has a built-in hex viewer for SQLite `BLOB` columns, which can be used to save a blob to a file for analysis
in a tool such as [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/) or [010](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/).
